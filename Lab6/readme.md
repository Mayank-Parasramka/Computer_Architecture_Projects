# Lab-6 (Cache Miss Simulator) - README 

## Important Note pls read:
The given Source file is a C++ code file which can be compiled by gcc.
```bash
This won't work
$ g++ lab5.cpp
$ ./a.out
```
Despite many attempts to make the code work for these commands it is outputing segmentation fault core dumped.
The reason could be the version of the compliler I beleive.
Although the good is giving 100% accurate if executed using the following steps. As it is working fine on my device.




## Installing VS Code:
VS code can be installed using
```bash
$ sudo snap install --classic code
$ code
```

After opening VS code set-up the code runner using g++ compiler which will be shown by default. Also install all the intellisense extentions in VS code.
After this press ctrl+shift+p and select C/C++ configuration (UI) option in it.

Have the following settings in it.
1.  Select a configuration set to edit. **Linux**
2. Compiler path: **/usr/bin/gcc**
3. IntelliSense mode: **linux-gcc-x64**

After enabling these settings pls execute the code using the code runner on the top right corner or by pressing the f9 key.
This should be giving the desired output.

To succesfully execute the code, keep the input files in the same directorty as the c++ code file and run using the VS code runner.
## Output:
The output will be given out in the terminal section of VS Code.
